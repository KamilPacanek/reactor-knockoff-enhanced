## Why?

During the time that it comes to me I want to learn a new Front End framework I was playing some incremental game hosted on the GitHub Pages - [Reactor Knockoff](https://cwmonkey.github.io/reactor-knockoff/). As the title suggested it took the concept from the other game ([Reactor Incremental](https://www.kongregate.com/games/Cael/reactor-incremental)), but after a while I realized that the GitHub one was incomplete and have its own issues.

This is when I decided to migrate the Reactor Knockoff by rewritting it completely using ReactJS [with the blessing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactorincremental/comments/b8hb9f/reactor_knockoff_higher_ep_generators/ek052wr) of the @cwmonkey - creator of the Reactor Knockoff.

## Status

Application is not even in its Alpha, yet the latest stable version is always available on https://kamilpacanek.github.io/reactor-knockoff-enhanced/

## Goal

The goal for me is to learn ReactJS during the development and familiarize with Git and GitHub. As for the game itselft - I'm aming at something similar to Reactor Knockoff with the missing features from the original game - enhanced with my vision.
